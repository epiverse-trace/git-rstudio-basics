## Your next step!

Good job! We recommend you to __read the supplemental episode__ on how to [use Git with the Rstudio IDE](14-supplemental-rstudio.md). It can make some steps easier to interact with! This also includes a section on how to [create new branches](14-supplemental-rstudio.md#create-a-branch) to experiment new features without affecting the main branch!

Also! You've now fulfill the core prerequisites for the tutorial on [Improve your code for Epidemic analysis with R](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/research-compendium/introduction.html#why-improve-our-code-for-epidemic-analysis)!

With `R`, `Git` and `GitHub` you will now extend your skills with a Research compendium, a Reproducible environment, and informative READMEs!

## Write an individual learning reflection

Before we wrap up, please take 5 minutes to think over everything we have covered so far. 

- On a piece of paper, write down something that captures what you want to remember about the day. 
- The Instructor will not look at this - it is just for you.
 
If you do not know where to start, consider the following list for a starting point:

- Draw a concept map, connecting the material
- Draw pictures or a comic depicting one of the day's concepts
- Write an outline of the topics we covered
- Write a paragraph or "journal" entry about your experience of the workshop today
- Write down one thing that struck you the most

This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

## Our communication channel
