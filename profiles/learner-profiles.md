title: Learner personas
---

This tutorial is pitched to beginners with basic knowledge of Git who wish to learn more. Three examples of the type of learner who would benefit from this tutorial are included below. The tutorial will be relevant to those from various backgrounds (research degree students, project managers, etc.)

We thought about Lucia, Patricia, and Pepe as learner personas in designing the contents of this training:

- **Lucia** is a Field epidemiologist. She uses R to clean data and create plots for outbreak response. She wants to communicate her doubts and ideas with package maintainers. [Read more about Lucia](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/personas/lucia-outbreaks.html).

- **Patricia** is a PhD student in a team with data analysts. She uses R to analyse infectious disease data. She wants to make her research code reusable and open to public. [Read more about Patricia](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/personas/patricia-discoverer.html).

- **Pepe** is a Project Manager interested in community building. He wants to learn how to provide feedback on contributing good practices to Open Science projects. [Read more about Pepe](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/personas/pepe-openmanager.html).
